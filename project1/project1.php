    <?php
    /*  All the project must be written in English.
    Create a new folder called project1.
    Use the file menu.html as a template for the horizontal menu.
    Create the following links in the navigation bar: Home | Form | DNI check
    In the hrefs the links must be something like: index.php?load=inicio, index.php?load=formulario, index.php?load=dni

    There will be only one php file: index.php. It will check the value of the load parameter and it will load in the page the corresponding contents. If the load parameter doesn't have any value assigned or has a wrong value, the default page will be loaded. We can include external files.

    The Home page must show:

    - The coordinates from your php.ini file (latitude and longitude of Santiago de Compostela).

    - Today's date, sunrise time, sunset time in Santiago de Compostela.

    The Form page must be like the image below but in English.

    After submitting the form:

    - The text input fields must be required (use PHP to check it).

    - Use all the security checks using PHP.

    - Check that the file is an image and set a limit for its size.

    - Show the information introduced by the user. Show the image.

    The DNI check page must ask for your DNI and check if it is correct using a function called dniCheck(). It will indicate if it is correct. You will use different colors for the message depending on the result shown. You can get information about the DNI check in: http://dni.zeo.es/obtener-letra-dni  */
