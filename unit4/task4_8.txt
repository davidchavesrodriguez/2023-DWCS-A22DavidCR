1. Indicate the differences between abstract classes and interfaces.
Interfaces can not have properties and all their methods must be public and abstract while abstract classes don't. Also,
classes can implement an interface while inheriting from another class.

2. Indicate the differences between Traits and abstract classes.
Only one abstract class can be inherited while traits support multiple inheritance and can be used without inherite from
another class. Also,abstract classes imply a hierarchy of classes and subclasses.

3. Indicate the differences between Traits and interfaces.
Traits are just blocks of code injected in a class while interfaces define the list of all methods a class should
implement so traits are used to eliminate redundance but interfaces just define how a class communicates.

4. Explain the meaning of Static properties using an example.
<?php
class eNumber
{
    private static $value = 2.71828;
}

?>
